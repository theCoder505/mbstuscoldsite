<h2 style="text-align: center;"> HERE ARE SOME METHODOLOGIES WHAT MAY HELP FOR HIGHER STUDY <h2> 


<h1 style="text-align: center;">MBSTUSC HIGHER STUDIES PLATFORM </h1>
<p style="text-align:center">
Higher studies are very much related with Science. And when the question is of a science club, 
there must exist a portion of Higher Studies. And as usual, it exists in our club. 
Usually, a science student dream to apply his/her knowledge in sectors. And they want to 
stay with Science till the end. For those students who love Science and want to keep with 
Science, higher studies are the dream for all of them. And <b>MBSTUSC</b> is the platform that helps
 a person knowing the ins and outs of it.Here in the article, we've given some basic ideas about
 Scholarship and higher studies and our club approaches. </p>

<h2>Why the higher study is needed </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
For this 21" century, a higher study is essential for a better and
comfortable lifestyle.</p> </br></br>

<b>Why we Need Higher Study mainly is discussed here.</b> </br>
1.For better job opportunities: There is a direct connection
between the level of education we achieve and our likelihood of finding a job.
 It allows us to choose a prosperous carrier.</br>

2. For financial security: People with some form of higher
education earn more money and have a lower possibility of unemployment.</br>
3. For personal development: High educated people lead more structured lives
 and more a stronger sense of responsibility.</br>

4. Civic involvement: When someone earns well, and his
network expands, he is more likely to give to charity and
become involved in volunteer work.</br>

5.Comfortable lifestyle: When someone has enough money to
need, enough food to eat and all other requirements of life, he/she have to
 lead a healthy lifestyle.</br>
<p style="text-align:center">
So, we can say that higher education can improve the overall
quality of life.</p></br>

<h2>Higher Studies By Scholarship </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
Usually, there are two types of scholarships. The one will provide you full free learning, and the 
others are about half free or a 70-75% free scholarship. </p>

<h4>Partial Funded Scholarship </h4>
<p style="text-align:center">
At that part, you just need to bear your living expenses. The other's payment 
regarding the university admission cost or additional costs related to the University 
will carry the Scholarship providing authority. Here you just need to bear your own expense.
 But it's pretty easy. You can get a part-time job quickly within a few months. 
The job will be regarding your unique skills. You can cut off your monthly needs by these jobs. 
You will get the time to have a part-time job continuing your study. But you must have the money to
 live at least six months comfortably after going to the country for a Scholarship. Usually, in foreign countries, 
 the rent of the home is much. But it’s better to go, having a half free or 70-75% scholarship. 
</p>



<h4>Full Funded Higher Studies </h4>
<p style="text-align:center">
In this platform you will get a scholarship where you just need not to do anything. Just sit
 for the exam and get the scholarship!  Then you will not need any money for both your living 
 cost and the University admission or other things related. Some will give you the air ticket also.
 Even some may give you a handsome pocket money also for your monthly other needs. That’s a great joy actually. 
Here you need not to do anything. But to get this scholarship,  you must have a great talent.
 And must have a good profile. All these things and your publications and research abilities will help you much here in this case. </p> 
 

<h2>Higher Study By Own Expanse </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
You also can have higher studies on your expanse. But here you won't get anything free. 
But you also need not have qualities like other students completing degrees by Scholarship.
 You can select the Universities you likewise and also select the best opportunities for your career.
 You just need to invest money there. 

But if the University commits any GRE or IELTS or TOFEL marks and any other things,
then you must have them. But obviously, this is not the same with the scholarship owners. </p>
 

<h2>What to do for Scholarship </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
Usually, for Scholarship, you need to first know about the countries you want to go to and receive Scholarships. 
You must find out the best Scholarship providing Universities providing a scholarship on your subject basis.
 Then you need to know about the applying procedure of those universities. But CGPA is a matter for many other universities.
 Here an 8.5+ GPA can help you. But some students got scholarships being below 8 GPA.
 Universities want to know about the skills you have, mainly.
You must show your expertness in the subjects you want to get a Scholarship in your CV.
 You can get ideas about it by joining our club or the Internet.  
If you have research papers or articles that are published, it will help you a lot. 
Cause the scholarship holders to judge your research ability. You must know about GRE, IELTS, and TOFEL.
Having a good profile that contains GRE 310+, IELS 7+ undergraduate minimum 8+,
 and you also have some national or International published papers. 
 You can be sure of getting a scholarship from the top-notch Universities.
 But if you have an average, you may give them a shot. 
 But it's better to choose the mid-level The Universities for your Scholarship.  
But it's an excellent trick to choose both the top-notch and mid-level Universities for your Scholarship. 
Whatever your profile is. Selecting some Universities of low-level Scholarship is also a safety trick. 
Lastly, you can choose the one you like if you get several scholarships. </p>
